Future plans
============

Reduce translation overhead.

Improve the adaptive compilation framework.  (Method metamorphosis,
more effective profiling, better use of profiles in the translator,
etc.)

Use 64 bit integer instructions on platforms that can use them.

More redundancy elimination in the translator (array bound checking
elimination, elimination of CHECKCAST following INSTANCEOF, etc.)


Features that should eventually implemented
===========================================

No bytecode verifier

No JNI.

No AWT.

No serialization.

No support for JAR or compressed ZIP archives.
