Global declarations made in the portions of the code not included in
the original Kaffe source are grouped by sections.  Each section has
an associated prefix, which is prepended along with an underbar to
each global declaration included in the section.

This file lists these prefixes along with a terse explanation of the
corresponding section in alphabetical order.

AllocStat	: register allocation status
AS      : representation of type of arguments
BA	: traverses bytecode and collect some information
BCode	: bytecode manipulation related
CFGGen	: translating bytecode into pseudo instructions
CodeGen	: native code generation
CMA     : memory allocator for JIT-compiled code
CN	: range based data structure used for finding a method with an address
CSeq	: generate some code sequences during cfg generation
EH	: exception handling related functions
EIT	: exception info table which is hash table of
	  (native pc, bytecode pc, variable maps)
FMA     : fast memory allocation
gc	: memory management system
IG	: method inlining related functions
Instr	: instruction node used for JIT compilation
intrp	: interpreter
JE	: jexception structure's getters and setters
JEE	: jexceptionEntry structure's getters and setters
MI	: method instance related functions
Pbc     : Profile bytecode
Reg	: physical register related functions
RegAlloc	: register allocation functions
RT	: runtime functions that used by translated code
SMA     : session-based memory allocation
TA      : type analysis
Var	: pseudo register called variable related functions
